FOLDER CONTENT:

README.txt -> this file
1st Phase Report.pdf -> the project report
akka-project/ -> the actual project
akka-project/test.sh -> script to run the tester

================================================================================

NOTES:

* The test.sh script was made to run on git-bash for Windows and might not work
for other OS/terminal combos. It uses an hard coded IP address for the tester
which must be changed before running it.

* The project must be compiled using `sbt pack` before running it.

* For a list of available project commands, type `help` once the node is up and
running.
